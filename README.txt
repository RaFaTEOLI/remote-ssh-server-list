Remote SSH - All servers at once

Through this PHP program using phpseclib you can execute a command on many servers all at once , without having to connect to each one to perform such action.

In this project there are two programs, one called remote_ssh.php, which is the pure code, where you can only set your command and execute it and one called remote_ssh_web where there is a web page to make it look better.

There is an sql file where I wrote a script to create the servers list, but if you have your own just replace your parameters on the mysql_conn/conn.php file.

And of course you have to change the parameters in order to open the connection with your servers.
